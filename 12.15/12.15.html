<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1> 
<p>The cottage garden is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p> <p>The Cottage Garden originated in England and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained English estate gardens.</p> <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
